# IOT_project-Environment-Safety-Monitor
Reads environmental data (ex: air pressure, gas presence, vibration, ambient noise) and sends it to a web page for viewing. If it detects abnormalities (ex: gas leak, earthquake, "boombs") it sends a notification to the user's phone.


We will be using two detectors, to showcase the ability to gather data from multiple locations and for the end user to be able to identify where the warning is coming from.
